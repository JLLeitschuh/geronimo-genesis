| Bootstrapping and Building |
+----------------------------+

Building for the first time
===========================

Genesis currently must be bootstrapped, which will build partial builds until
all plugins are available.

You will need Ant installed and available in the search path of your shell.

To perform a clean bootstrap simply run:

    ./bootstrap

Both will run a multi-stage build.  When making changes it is recommended to
run `bootstrap` to ensure that no locally installed artifacts are interfering
with a clean build.


Subsequent builds
=================

After the initial bootstrap build, the `mvn` command can be used.

To build all changes incrementally:

    mvn install

To perform clean builds, which are sometimes needed after some changes to the 
source tree:

    mvn clean install
