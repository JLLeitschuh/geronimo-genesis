enable/disable categories.  Command def sets the initial state, 'enable' command
    toggles to enable or disable categories:

    # enable all categories ending with debug
    /gshell/debug *debug

"*" means global for category

Settings, read from ~/.gshell/...

    ~/.gshell/
        profile.gsh
        settings.gsh?  settings.properties?  settings.xml?

MOTD-like support... Execute a "welcome.gsh" or something?

 * * *

Implement MiniJar to make the gshell dependencies as small as possible,
    will require adding more features to minijar (half tested already)

 * * *

Maybe just use the JLine API directly instead of trying to abstract it?

Command line completion ala JLine

Refactor output and verbosity filters...

    IO.trace() -vvv
    IO.debug() -vv
Add IO.info()  -v
    IO.warn()  unless -q
    IO.error()

ANSI color prompt

ANSI color G-logo (ANSI-art style)

Authenticator for server cmd, maybe for normal too?

SSH support?  Can Jsch do this or not?

New commands:

    source
    ssh?
    subshell
    exec

Implement VFS-based commands to access any directory!!!
