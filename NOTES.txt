 ----

Add ${...} parsing to the CommandLineParser; remove VariableExpressionParser

Switch to Object execute(String name, Object...)

Hook up backtick and execute assign bits... foo=`echo bar`
    Dunno if this captures the output of 'echo bar' or the return of the command
    Might need to have both?

    Once object are in and out, this will open up a bunch of op to do fancy stuff.

 * * *

enable/disable categories.  Command def sets the initial state, 'enable' command
    toggles to enable or disable categories:

    # enable all categories ending with debug
    /gshell/debug *debug

"*" means global for category

Command search path (required for above)
    ~/.gshell/
        profile.gsh
        settings.gsh?  settings.properties?  settings.xml?

 * * *

Settings, read from ~/.gshell/...

MOTD-like support... Execute a "welcome.gsh" or something?

 * * *

Implement MiniJar to make the gshell dependencies as small as possible,
    will require adding more features to minijar (half tested already)

 * * *

Maybe just use the JLine API directly instead of trying to abstract it?

Refactor output and verbosity filters...

        IO.trace() -vvv
        IO.debug() -vv
    Add IO.info()  -v
        IO.warn()  unless -q
        IO.error()

    This means that IO will need to know the verbosity setting... :-(

    Need methods to handle exceptions too, for remoteness can not use logging for error reporting

ANSI color prompt

ANSI color G-logo (ANSI-art style)

 * * *

Authenticator for server cmd, maybe for normal too?

SSH support?  Can Jsch do this or not?

Fix the input handing for teling... for some reason input starts with x0 when it shouldn't
    and using arrows can corrupt... bet these are linked some how

 * * *

New commands:

    source
    ssh?
    subshell
    exec

Implement VFS-based commands to access any directory!!!
    /vfs/get ftp://whatever
    /vfs/browser ftp://whatever
    ...

Convert all commands to use MessageSource
